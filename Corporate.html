                <p id="history">In 1965, Yale University undergraduate Frederick W. Smith wrote a term paper that invented an industry and changed what&rsquo;s possible. In the paper, he laid out the logistical challenges facing pioneering firms in the information technology
                    industry. Most airfreight shippers relied on passenger route systems, but those didn&rsquo;t make economic sense for urgent shipments, Smith wrote.</p>
                <p id="history">In August 1971, following a stint in the military, Smith bought controlling interest in Arkansas Aviation Sales, located in Little Rock, Arkansas. While operating his new firm, he saw firsthand how difficult it was to get packages and
                    other airfreight delivered within one to two days. With his term paper in mind, Smith set out to find a better way. Thus the idea for Federal Express was born: A company that has revolutionized global business practices and that now
                    defines speed and reliability.</p>
                <p id="history">Smith named the company Federal Express because he believed the patriotic meaning associated with the word &ldquo;federal&rdquo; suggested an interest in nationwide economic activity. He also hoped the name would resonate with the Federal
                    Reserve Bank, a potential customer. Although the bank denied his proposal, Smith kept the name because he thought it was memorable and would help attract public attention</p>
                <p id="history">Company headquarters later moved to Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis was chosen because of its central location within the U.S. and because Memphis International Airport was rarely closed due to bad weather. The airport was also willing to
                    make the necessary improvements for the operation and additional hangar space was readily available. <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/about/history.html#:~:text=%20In%20addition%3A%20%201%20Federal%20Express%20became,when%20FedEx%20finalized%20the%20acquisition%20of...%20More%20"
